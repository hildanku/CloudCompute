NOTES:
CHART NAME: rabbitmq
CHART VERSION: 13.0.0
APP VERSION: 3.12.13** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

Credentials:
    echo "Username      : user"
    echo "Password      : $(kubectl get secret --namespace default rabbitmq-server -o jsonpath="{.data.rabbitmq-password}" | base64 -d)"
    echo "ErLang Cookie : $(kubectl get secret --namespace default rabbitmq-server -o jsonpath="{.data.rabbitmq-erlang-cookie}" | base64 -d)"

Note that the credentials are saved in persistent volume claims and will not be changed upon upgrade or reinstallation unless the persistent volume claim has been deleted. If this is not the first installation of this chart, the credentials may not be valid.
This is applicable when no passwords are set and therefore the random password is autogenerated. In case of using a fixed password, you should specify it when upgrading.
More information about the credentials may be found at https://docs.bitnami.com/general/how-to/troubleshoot-helm-chart-issues/#credential-errors-while-upgrading-chart-releases.
